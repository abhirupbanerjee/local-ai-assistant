## 1. Next.js 16: Segment Config Exports Must Be Static Literals

**Status:** Active limitation
**Affected files:** All `route.ts` files using `maxDuration`, `runtime`, etc.
**Date discovered:** 2026-04-04

### Problem

Next.js 16 (Turbopack) requires route segment config exports (`maxDuration`, `runtime`, `dynamic`, etc.) to be **static literals** evaluated at build time. Any runtime expression causes a build failure:

```
Error: Invalid segment configuration export detected:
  "maxDuration" with value "parseInt(process.env.STREAM_MAX_DURATION || '300', 10)"
  is not a valid value for this configuration.
```

This means you **cannot** use environment variables, function calls, or any computed values:

```typescript
// FAILS at build time
export const maxDuration = parseInt(process.env.STREAM_MAX_DURATION || '300', 10);
export const maxDuration = Number(process.env.MY_VAR);
export const maxDuration = getConfig().timeout;

// WORKS — must be a plain number literal
export const maxDuration = 1800;
```

### Current Fix

All route segment configs use static literal `1800` (30 minutes). This is a generous outer safety net — the actual stream duration is controlled by the DB-configurable `streaming_max_duration` setting (admin UI: Agent Settings, range 60–600s).

### Affected Routes

| Route | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `src/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts` | `1800` | Chat streaming (autonomous mode can run long) |
| `src/app/api/admin/backup/restore/route.ts` | `1800` | Backup restore (large files) |
| `src/app/api/admin/backup/files/trigger/route.ts` | `1800` | Backup trigger |

### Related Note

The OpenAI client in `src/lib/openai.ts` has a separate `timeout: 300_000` (5 minutes) for individual API calls. This is independent of the route-level `maxDuration` and controls how long to wait for the upstream LLM provider to respond.

## 2. Next.js 16: Middleware File Convention Deprecated

**Status:** Active — using deprecated convention intentionally
**Affected files:** `src/middleware.ts`
**Date discovered:** 2026-01-01 (Next.js 16 upgrade)

### Problem

Next.js 16 deprecated the `middleware.ts` file convention in favor of the new `proxy` pattern. The build warns:

```
middleware file convention is deprecated, use proxy instead
```

### Why We Still Use middleware.ts

The project was briefly migrated to `proxy.ts` (commit `1a53261`, Jan 2026) but reverted back to `middleware.ts` (commit `d56d811`, Apr 2026) because:

1. **Dynamic CSP headers for embed routes**: The `/e/*` (embed widget) routes require runtime-dynamic `Content-Security-Policy` headers with `frame-ancestors` set from the `ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS` environment variable. The `next.config.ts` `headers()` function only supports build-time values — it cannot read runtime env vars.

2. **Route-level auth decisions**: The middleware handles authentication redirects (unauthenticated users → `/auth/signin`) and landing page logic (authenticated users on `/` → `/chat`). These require request-time session checks.

3. **The Next.js 16 proxy pattern** does not provide equivalent request/response header manipulation capabilities needed for our CSP use case.

### What the Middleware Does

```
Request → middleware.ts
  ├─ /e/* routes → Set dynamic CSP frame-ancestors from ALLOWED_EMBED_ORIGINS env var
  ├─ / (root) → Redirect authenticated users to /chat
  └─ All other routes → Redirect to /auth/signin if not authenticated
```

### Future Resolution Options

1. **Keep middleware.ts** — current approach, works despite deprecation warning
2. **Move CSP to Traefik** — handle `frame-ancestors` at the reverse proxy level (docker-compose already uses Traefik)
3. **Per-route CSP** — set headers in individual `/e/*` API route handlers instead of middleware
4. **Wait for Next.js** — future versions may provide runtime header middleware in the proxy pattern

## 3. LiteLLM Breaks Anthropic Streaming Tool-Call JSON Assembly

**Status:** Fixed — permanent architectural bypass
**Affected files:** `src/lib/openai.ts`
**Date discovered:** March 2026

### Problem

When Claude models were routed through LiteLLM, the proxy translated Anthropic's native `tool_use` content blocks into OpenAI-compatible `delta.tool_calls` format during streaming. This JSON assembly was **unreliable** — LiteLLM would produce malformed tool-calling JSON that failed `executeTool()` parsing.

**Symptoms:**
- `doc_gen`, `xlsx_gen`, and `pptx_gen` tools failed intermittently with JSON parse errors
- Tool call arguments arrived as broken JSON strings after LiteLLM's chunked reassembly
- Affected all Claude models (Sonnet, Haiku, Opus) when tool calling was involved

### Root Cause

LiteLLM's streaming format converter reassembles tool input JSON from streamed `delta.tool_calls` chunks. For Anthropic models, this reassembly loses fidelity — partial JSON fragments get concatenated incorrectly, producing unparseable arguments.

### Fix Applied

Claude models now bypass LiteLLM entirely for chat completions, using the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` directly:

1. **Detection:** `isClaudeModel(model)` checks for `anthropic/` or `claude-` prefix
2. **Routing:** If Claude, `streamAnthropicCompletion()` is called instead of the OpenAI/LiteLLM path
3. **Key difference:** The direct SDK's `stream.finalMessage()` returns **pre-parsed** `block.input` objects (structured data), not JSON strings from chunked reassembly

```typescript
// Direct SDK — tool inputs arrive as already-parsed objects
for (const block of message.content) {
  if (block.type === 'tool_use') {
    toolCalls.push({ id: block.id, name: block.name, input: block.input });
  }
}
// Convert to OpenAI-compatible format for downstream executeTool()
const openaiToolCalls = toolCalls.map(tc => ({
  id: tc.id, type: 'function' as const,
  function: { name: tc.name, arguments: JSON.stringify(tc.input) },
}));
```

### Architecture Impact

Added **Tier 1b** to the LLM architecture:

| Tier | Path | Providers |
|------|------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | LiteLLM Proxy | OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, DeepSeek, Ollama, Fireworks |
| **Tier 1b** | **Anthropic Direct SDK** | **Claude (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)** |
| Tier 2 | Direct Provider APIs | Fireworks reranking, Tavily, OpenAI TTS |
| Tier 3 | Google GenAI SDK | Gemini Imagen, TTS |

Claude models are still registered with LiteLLM for non-chat services (embeddings, etc.). Only **chat completions with tool calling** bypass LiteLLM.

## 4. Ollama Chat 400s and Qdrant Embedding Dimension Mismatch

**Status:** Fixed in request handling; reindex still required after embedding-model changes
**Affected files:** `src/lib/openai.ts`, `src/lib/llm-client.ts`, `src/lib/llm-fallback.ts`, `src/lib/vector-store/qdrant.ts`
**Date discovered:** 2026-04-25

### Problem

After switching to local Ollama models, chat streaming failed with a generic `Bad Request` error. The failure had two separate causes that appeared in the same user flow:

1. Ollama chat requests were not always being treated as Ollama after model IDs were normalized.
2. RAG search could fail before chat generation when Qdrant collections had vectors from an older embedding model.

The confirmed working path now shows:

```text
[Embedding] Ollama direct — Model: qwen3-embedding:0.6b, Dimensions: 1024, Count: 1
[Qdrant] Skipping collection global_documents: vector size mismatch (collection=3072, query=1024). Reindex documents after changing embedding models.
[Chat] Using Ollama directly for model: ollama-gemma3
```

### Root Cause

The chat path converted internal Ollama IDs such as `ollama-gemma3` to raw API model IDs such as `gemma3` before streaming. `streamOneCompletion()` then tried to infer whether the request was Ollama by checking only for `ollama-` or `ollama/`, so raw Ollama IDs could be misclassified.

The OpenAI-compatible Ollama endpoint also does not accept native per-request options such as `num_ctx` in the chat completion payload. Context size must be configured through the Ollama model/server, for example with a Modelfile `PARAMETER num_ctx`.

Separately, Qdrant collections preserve the vector dimension they were created with. If documents were indexed with OpenAI embeddings at 3072 dimensions and the active embedding model becomes `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` at 1024 dimensions, Qdrant returns a 400 on search.

### Fix Applied

Ollama chat handling:

1. Added provider-aware Ollama routing using `enabled_models.provider_id === 'ollama'`, while keeping old prefix checks for `ollama-*` and `ollama/...`.
2. Passed an explicit `isOllama` flag into `streamOneCompletion()` so the stream helper does not guess from a normalized raw model name.
3. Removed Ollama `num_ctx` / `options` from OpenAI-compatible chat completion payloads.
4. For Ollama final summary/text-only calls after tools, omitted `tools` and `tool_choice` instead of sending `tool_choice: 'none'`.

Qdrant/RAG handling:

1. Added a collection vector-size preflight before `qdrant.search()`.
2. Skips collections whose stored vector size does not match the query embedding length.
3. Converts Qdrant search 400s into clear warnings that identify the collection and vector sizes.
4. Allows chat to continue with no RAG context instead of failing the whole stream.

### Operational Follow-up

The fix prevents the generic Bad Request from killing chat, but skipped collections are not searchable. After changing embedding models, run the reindex job so Qdrant collections are recreated with the active embedding dimension.

Expected warning until reindex is complete:

```text
[Qdrant] Skipping collection <name>: vector size mismatch (collection=3072, query=1024). Reindex documents after changing embedding models.
```

### Verification

`npm run type-check` passed after regenerating stale Next generated route types. `git diff --check` passed for the edited source files.

Local chat with `gemma3` produced a streamed response after the fix, with RAG collections skipped because they still contain 3072-dimensional vectors.
